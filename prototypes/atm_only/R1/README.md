# Atm-only run
This is the second attempt to run the atm-only configuration with full 27 years of 
REPLAY data with surface(skin) temperature. The difference here wrt R0 is that the 
specific humidity is not log transformed. This is to debug the instability of the 
inferences of the atm_only prototype. 

# Outcome
