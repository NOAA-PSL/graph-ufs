# Ocn-only run
This is the second attempt to run the ocean-only configuration with full 27 years of 
REPLAY data with 10m U-V from atmosphere as forcing. In this run, the standard deviation
of all prognostic ocean variables are bumped up to 6 times their value in R0. Hopefully,
this would calm down the loss curve.

## Outcome
